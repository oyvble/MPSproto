MPSproto is a tool which contains a quantitative model for MPS-STR data to deal with complex stutters.

Installation for Windows (http://www.euroformix.com/MPSproto): 
install.packages('http://www.euroformix.com/sites/default/files/MPSproto_0.8.1.zip',repos=NULL,type='win.binary')

Installation from Github (https://github.com/oyvble/MPSproto):
install_github("oyvble/MPSproto")

Download zip file from http://www.euroformix.com/MPSproto (windows only) and "install package local ".

Mathematical details of the model and a tutorial for how to use the tool can be found in the doc folder.

The tool was first time mentioned in the discussion of the paper "A comprehensive characterization of STR-MPS stutter artefacts". 
- Folder MPSproto_stutterCharPaper in the MPSproto installation directory contains scripts for the calibration and examples of interpretation


The allele format for MPS data must be the "Forward_Strand_Bracketed_form" from LUSstr (https://github.com/bioforensics/lusSTR).

An explanation about the nomenclature of the different stutter types used in the program:
BW1= ‘n-1’ for longest motif-repeat
FW1= ‘n+1’ for longest motif-repeat
DBW1= ‘n-2’ for longest motif-repeat (double back stutter)
TBW1= ‘n-3’ for longest motif-repeat (tripple back stutter)
etc..
For more complex sequences:
BW2= ‘n-1’ for second longest motif-repeat
FWBW= ‘n+1’ for longest motif-repeat and ‘n-1’ for second longest motif-repeat
BWFW= ‘n-1’ for longest motif-repeat og ‘n+1’ for second longest motif-repeat

The software also support traditional CE data, with stutters BW1, FW1, DBW1 as supported stutter types.
